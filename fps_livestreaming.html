											First-person shooter (FPS) game tournaments take place across the globe. 
											A growing number of people choose to watch FPS games online instead of attending the game events in person. 
											However, live streaming might miss critical highlight moments in the game, including kills and tactics. 
											We identify how and why the live streaming team fails to capture highlight moments to reduce such live streaming mistakes. 
											We named such mistakes <em>Jarring Observations</em>.
										  </p>
										  
										  <p>
											We conducted a field study of live streaming competitions of 
											<em>Game For Peace</em>, a popular FPS mobile game, to summarize five typical 
											<em>Jarring Observations</em> and identify three primary reasons that caused the issues. 
											We further studied how to improve the live streaming system to prevent 
											<em>Jarring Observations</em> from happening by doing semi-structured interviews with 
											two professional streaming teams for <em>Game For Peace</em>. <strong>The study showed that a better system should: (1) add a new sub-team role to share the director's responsibility of managing observers; (2) provide interfaces customized for three roles of live streamers in the team; (3) abstract more geographical info; (4) predict the priority of observation targets; and (5) provide non-verbal interfaces for sync-up between sub-teams</strong>.
											Our work provides insights for esports streaming system researchers and developers 
											to improve the system for a smoother audience experience.

									<h2>Field Study and Survey</h2>

									<p>
										We conducted a field study in the real setting where the live streaming team worked for a two-day esports tournament of 
										<em>Game for Peace</em>, a battle royal shooter game created by <em>Lightspeed Studio</em>. 
										Then, we surveyed eight professional live streamers to find out the causes of 
										<em>Jarring Observations</em>. 
									</p>

										<h3>Methodology</h3>

										<p>
											Based on the audience complaints of <em>jarring observations</em>, we paid attention to identifying and categorizing the 
											<em>jarring observations</em> that happened during the live streaming service. 
											During the field study, we also recorded how the live streaming team cooperates as a team. 
											After the live streaming service ended, we prompted questions about how the teamwork structure formed 
											and the functions of specific live streaming system interfaces. 
											After the field study, we transcribed the communication information and used the open coding method 
											to identify the common <em>jarring observations</em>.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Based on the results of the field study, we surveyed eight professional live streamers, including one director 
											and seven observers, to study the causes of <em>jarring observations</em>. 
											To complete the survey, the participants first read the description of <em>jarring observations</em> 
											and then answered the following open-ended questions for each <em>Jarring Observation</em> scenario:
										</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Q1:</strong> Did you encounter such kind of scenario?</li>
											<li><strong>Q2:</strong> How does the scenario influence live streaming? What are the benefits and harms?</li>
											<li><strong>Q3:</strong> On a scale of one (definitely not) to five (definitely yes), how much does the scenario negatively affect a live streaming experience?</li>
											<li><strong>Q4:</strong> How would you deal with the scenario?</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>
											We used a mixed-method approach to analyze the results of the surveys.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Teamwork Structure</h3>
				
										<p>
										<span class="image right">
										  <img src="images/FPS Live Streaming/TeamWorkflow.jpg" alt="Training Visualization" />
										</span>
										<p>
											In general, the live streaming team for FPS esports is divided into two sub-teams: the director and the observer(s). 
											The director instructs observers to monitor specific players and capture the players' highlight moments. 
											The director can receive multiple video streams from the observers on a big monitor screen. 
											Occasionally, the observers may speak up loudly to update an ongoing event to the whole team.
										  </p>
										  
										  <p>
											In our field study, we further observed that the live streaming team refined their teamwork structure 
											by delegating one of the observers only to take charge of reporting the critical events observed 
											from the game's mini-map, which is called a <strong>map observer</strong> (see right image).  
											The map observer shares the director's responsibility to monitor critical in-game events. 
											However, we found from our field study that this position did not yet address how players communicate 
											with each other by shouting out messages, which caused chaotic moments that led to 
											<em>jarring observations</em>.
										  </p>
										  
										</p>

										<h3>Live Streaming System Interfaces</h3>

										<p>
											<span class="image left">
												<img src="images/FPS Live Streaming/Views.jpg" alt="Training Visualization" style="width:100%; max-width:1000px; height:auto;" />
											</span>
											<p>
												In our field study, we found that the live streaming system provided different interfaces for the director and the observers. 
												The observers mainly operated the virtual in-game camera in four modes as shown in the left image: 
												a first-person view, a third-person view, a free-roam view, and a follow mode view. 
												We did not find that this camera operations design might potentially cause 
												<em>jarring observations</em>.
											</p>

											<p>
												The observers also showed their system's front-end display that provides the following information: 
												players' names, equipment, utility trajectory, and kills. 
												To keep tracking the player hidden behind a wall, the observer can enter the 
												<q>Wall Hack</q> mode to see through a physical wall. 
												The examples of the <q>Wall Hack</q> mode and the utility trajectory visualization are shown in 
												the left image. 
												Neither did we find that the design of the front-end display might potentially cause 
												<em>jarring observations</em>.
											</p>
											
											<p>
												The director sits in front of a huge multi-screen monitor. 
												The multi-screen monitor receives live video signals coming from the observers. 
												The monitor provides two additional special screens besides the observers' screens: 
												the <strong>PGM</strong> screen displays the current video signals that the audience is watching, 
												and the <strong>PV</strong> screen displays the video signals from another source that is ready to switch to. 
												The director assigned an observer's streaming video to one of the special screens through a physical button on a keypad. 
												We found that the director was distracted by not being able to maintain an intensively high level of focus 
												while managing multiple screens for a long period, which resulted in some 
												<em>jarring observations</em>.
											</p>

										<h3>Typical Jarring Observations and Primary Causes</h3>

											We summarized five typical <em>jarring observations</em> that we recorded in the field study.
											We also derived the underlying causes for each of the five <em>jarring observations</em> recorded in the field study.

									<h2>Design Recommendations to Prevent Jarring Observations</h2>

									<p>
										In order to propose useful design recommendations to prevent the <i>jarring observations</i> from happening, 
										we conducted two interviews with two professional FPS games live streaming teams. 
										The interviews were conducted on <i>Tencent Meeting</i>, an online meeting tool, 
										and lasted between 90 and 120 minutes.
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										Findings from the interview suggest improving team structure of the live streaming team, 
										enriching game data display, and providing AI prediction features during live streaming. 
										We conclude with five design recommendations to help the team prevent 
										<i>jarring observations</i>:
									  </p>
									  
									  <ul>
										<li><b>RD1</b>: Add a new sub-team role, the commander, to share the director's responsibility of managing observers;</li>
										<li><b>RD2</b>: Provide interfaces customized for three roles of live streamers in the team;</li>
										<li><b>RD3</b>: Abstract more geographical information;</li>
										<li><b>RD4</b>: Predict the observation priority of players;</li>
										<li><b>RD5</b>: Design non-verbal interfaces for sync-up between sub-teams.</li>
									  </ul>
									
									  <h3>Communication-Efficient Live Streaming Team Structure</h3>

									  <p>
										<span class="image left">
											<img src="images/FPS Live Streaming/Commander.jpg" alt="Training Visualization" />
										</span>
										<p>
											Team structure in the current live streaming team is redundant since each position's responsibility is unclear, which causes overlapping workflow. 
											It is necessary to add a new position between the director and the observer, whose duty includes in-game events sync-up and issuing tracking instructions to observers. 
											Moreover, the director should only take charge of selecting scenes for streaming, while the observer should only focus on capturing highlights. 
											As a director suggested, “I think we should not provide too much information for the director. Since I need to keep an eye on around ten screens, any other irrelevant information distracts me.” 
										  </p>
										  
										  <p>
											In actual practice, some professional live streaming teams set a subgroup named “Scheduler” which “tracks all game teams' moving tendencies, updates battle situations, and predicts the next potential highlights.” 
											By adding this subgroup and simplifying the duties of the Director and the Observer, we can reach “a top-down workflow” and “alleviate communication stress during live streaming.” Based on our interviews, we proposed a novel team structure (see left image).

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>In conclusion, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating and modifying 3D human body models using text and image inputs, combining parametric models with LLMs. We redefined and labeled the body parameters in the parametric models and trained a specialized version of ChatGPT to translate natural language descriptions into body parameter sets or adjustments. For text-based model modification, we designed a mapping method that transforms body measurements into body parameters to support the modification process better. By introducing an interactive interface, we offer an accessible and customizable approach to 3D body modeling. This development highlights the potential of LLMs to support more personalized and motivational applications in areas like fitness, where users can visualize potential physical improvements. In this context, our survey evaluates the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs, which lays the foundation for future research on enhancing user engagement and model precision. In the future, we aim to improve the pipeline by implementing everything locally and gathering more human body data to enhance the model's accuracy.</p> -->
